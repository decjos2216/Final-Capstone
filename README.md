# Final-Capstone
Python based framework for developing data processing programs.

# Motivation
Having completed nine months of programing classes, I've come to understand just how much time goes into developing programs. From the time it takes to plan out how your program will function to typing up the code to troubleshooting the program, there is a great deal of time that goes into it. Since time is money, especially to a business, anything that can speed up development and reduce the time it takes to type up code can add up to incredible savings. I decided to create this framework to be a solution to long development times for small programs that process or consolidate data, which are some of the more commonly demanded programs in businesses.

# Instruction for use
Step 1: Run the Framework program

Step 2: Enter in the name of each label you want to use and which type of variable you want the input data to be stored as. Use the
        'Add row' and 'Delete row' button to add or remove more labels.

Step 3: (Optional) Press the 'Add Graph' button to add a graph to the program. Enter in the label for each graph axis in the window that         pops up.

Step 4: Press the 'Create Program' button and choose a location to save the program and formula files.

Step 5: Open up the Formula file and enter how you want the program data to be calculated. Enter in the graph formula if applicable.

Step 6: Make any additional changes to program file as needed.

Step 7: Compile program.

# Important notes

FRAMEWORK INFORMATION

--- The data type you choose for each label determines if the program will check it for an accepted input. String data types are not checked, Numbers data type will only allow numerical values. If imporper data is entered into the program, the entry will be deleted and highlighted when the 'Calculate' or 'Graph' buttons are pressed, in addition to a pop up warning.

--- When choosing a place to save the program, make sure the program has access to the Objects.py and Graph.py files. Either make a copy of those files in the program location or change the program to locate the files in a different location.

PROGRAM INFORMATION

--- Do not close the Turtle window created by the graph until you are completely finished with the program. Graphs cannot be redrawn after the window is closed. Click on the Turtle window to clear the current image.
